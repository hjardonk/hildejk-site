My work is in dynamical systems and its applications.

### Slow–fast dynamics and critical transitions

Many natural and engineered systems operate across multiple time scales. I study geometric mechanisms underlying abrupt transitions, delayed loss of stability, and multiscale instabilities, with an emphasis on global phase-space structure.

### Bifurcation, singularity theory, and desingularization

I use ideas and techniques from singularity and bifurcation theory to analyze degenerate structures that organize the dynamics of differential equations. Many slow–fast systems exhibit non-hyperbolic points where classical perturbation theory breaks down. These degeneracies act as organizing centers for global bifurcations and phase-space geometry.

A central theme of my work is the systematic desingularization of such points via blow-up and related geometric techniques. This transforms non-generic configurations into higher-dimensional but regular systems where invariant manifolds, stability, and bifurcation mechanisms can be studied with standard tools. This ultimately yields precise information about the original system and its parameter dependence.

### Networked dynamical systems

Many realistic models consist of subsystems coupled through a network. I study how network structure constrains and shapes dynamics, especially when interactions occur across multiple time or organizational scales. A particular focus is on adaptive and higher-order network effects, and how they modify collective behavior and the validity of classical reduction methods.

## Current directions

- Bridging singularity and bifurcation theory with constrained network dynamics.
- Understanding how network topology shapes collective dynamics and pattern formation.
- Analyzing adaptive and neuromorphic networks from a dynamical systems perspective.
- Developing applications of geometric singular perturbation theory in the life sciences.


## Collaboration

I enjoy collaborations with researchers in (applied) mathematics, control theory, mathematical neuroscience, engineering, (systems) biology, chemistry, etc. especially where a model suggests a clear mathematical question.
